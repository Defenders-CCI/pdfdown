\description{
Test if a file is a pdf
}
\details{
All PDFs should have a dictionary that contains information about
the key metadata about the document. This function uses
\link[pdftools]{pdf_info} to check if the downloaded file is, in fact, a PDF
because too often we get something other than the PDF, e.g., an HTML status
404 download.
